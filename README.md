Multiple Linear Regression for Stock Price Prediction
Overview
This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model using Gradient Descent to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on the adjusted close prices of multiple stocks and attempts to predict the price of a target stock using the prices of other stocks as features. The project is written in Python and utilizes several libraries for data collection, processing, and visualization.

Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to provide a hands-on example of how Multiple Linear Regression can be applied to financial data. Stock prices often move in relation to one another, and this project demonstrates how to use the historical prices of multiple stocks to predict the future price of another stock.

Mathematical Background
Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression models the relationship between one dependent variable (e.g., the target stock price) and multiple independent variables (e.g., other stock prices). It assumes a linear relationship where the price of the target stock is predicted based on a weighted sum of the other stocks' prices.

Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is used to minimize the error between the predicted and actual stock prices by iteratively adjusting the model's weights (coefficients) to find the best fit.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance, scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-linear-regression-stock-prediction.git
cd multiple-linear-regression-stock-prediction
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Import the necessary classes and functions.
Create an instance of MyStocks with the desired tickers, start date, and end date.
Use the train_regression() method to train the model.
Predict stock prices using predict_price() by providing new data.
Example
python
Copy code
from src.my_stocks import MyStocks

tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']
start_date = '2023-01-01'
end_date = '2024-01-01'

stock_analyzer = MyStocks(tickers, start_date, end_date)
stock_analyzer.plot_data()
stock_analyzer.train_regression()

# Predicting AAPL price using example MSFT and GOOGL prices
feature_values = [150, 2800]  # Example values for MSFT and GOOGL
predicted_price = stock_analyzer.predict_price(feature_values)
print(f"Predicted price for AAPL: ${predicted_price:.2f}")
Results
The project outputs:

The cost of the model on the test set.
A plot comparing predicted vs. actual values for the target stock.
The predicted price for the target stock based on the provided feature values.
Future Work
Implement additional evaluation metrics such as R-squared.
Extend the model to incorporate more features.
Allow dynamic selection of target and feature stocks.
Implement more sophisticated normalization methods.
